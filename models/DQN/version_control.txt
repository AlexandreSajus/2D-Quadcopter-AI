models4 is the first successful attempt at training DQN (exp from 0.9 to 0.2 with exploration_decay = 6e-7)

models6 is the continuation of models4 (exp from 0.9 to 0.2 with exploration_decay = 6e-7)

models7 is the continuation of models4 (exp from 1 to 7.5 with exploration_decay = 2e-7)

models8 is the continuation of models7 (exp from 7.5 to 4.8 with exploration_decay = 2e-7)

models9 is the continuation of models8 (exp from 4.8 to 3.4 with exploration_decay = 2e-7)
